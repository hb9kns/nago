# nago -- nano-gopher client

`nago` is a small shell script working as a [Gopher][] client. It
makes use of command line tools normally part of most Unix systems,
and is a somewhat ugly hack I wrote as a personal exercise.

## usage

*run nago (or nago.sh) without arguments to get a short help*

## configuration

*missing, needs info about choosing the right tools in functions*
